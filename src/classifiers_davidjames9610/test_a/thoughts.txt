a files to samples
    more general somehow
    - needs VAD

b samples to features
    include
        Gauss Noise [ ]
        Reverb [ ]
        Real Noise

c features to classifier
    include fhmm

d classifier to results
    decode combine results [ ]
    annotations [ ]

what output formats are possible here / do we want ?

classification
    this is per sample operation, where we score on each sample and choose the best classifier

decode_combine
    this is Viterbi, we get a class for each bin, depends on accuracy of annotations
    result of this can be shown in confusion matrix
    just get this working for the moment, then go back to samples to features
