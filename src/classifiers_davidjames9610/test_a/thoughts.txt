a files to samples
    general - done - sr = 22050
    VAD for i vectors - done sr - 16000
    whale - [ ] # todo

b samples to features
    include
        Gauss Noise - done
        Reverb [ ]
        Real Noise - need to do

c features to classifier
    include fhmm

d classifier to results
    decode combine results [ ]
    annotations [ ]

what output formats are possible here / do we want ?

classification
    this is per sample operation, where we score on each sample and choose the best classifier

decode_combine
    this is Viterbi, we get a class for each bin, depends on accuracy of annotations
    result of this can be shown in confusion matrix
    just get this working for the moment, then go back to samples to features,

    log power features, # todo
    classifier GMM, # todo
